Introduction

The International Organization for Migration (IOM, 2022) is an intergovernmental organization that seeks to promote orderly human migration. On its website, it establishes that a migrant is: "Anyone who moves outside their usual place of residence, either within a country or across an international border, temporarily or permanently, and for various reasons." (para. 1) Similarly, the United Nations Organization establishes the term "international migrant" to define the person "who changes their country of habitual residence, distinguishing between "short-term migrants" (who change their country of habitual residence for periods of at least three months, but less than a year) and “long-term migrants” (who move for periods of at least one year)” (UN Migration, 2020, p. 23).
